# CxLos14-CMS-BlogSite

## Description

```
The motivation behind building this was to fully integrate everything we have learned in class so far to build my first full stack application. I made this application so that users can sign in and create an account for a blog site where they can share and post their thoughts. This app isn't so much a problem solver like some of my other apps, but more so a fun interactive social media-like site. Building this project, I learned the importance of having all of your routes set up correctly as it can easily get very confusing and make your site crash. I learned how to integrate all aspects of the MVC model to make a fully functional site. I also learned how tricky it is deploying to Heroku and figured out that file structure is case sensitive so it is very important to make sure everything matches 100%.
